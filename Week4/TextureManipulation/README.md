# Texture Manipulation.
This project will change the textures on a model.
It also features an FPS limitation (VSync), which dramatically reduces CPU usage. The VSync automatically adjusts to the display's refresh rate on launch, and ensures the program runs at the same speed on all computers.

This project uses TLEngine V2.3 Beta 5.
Platform Toolset v142.
Latest installed Windows 10 SDK.
